# Infrared-Sensor
Project for Sensors and Actuators Class
  The goal of this project is to put together, research, and test an infrared sensor. It is fairly simple. The sensor can be plugged directly into the arduino. I borrowed coding that computes the distance of an object. The ideal aspects of the sensor should be researched and provided. The realistic aspects of the sensor should be provided by different tests and experiments.
